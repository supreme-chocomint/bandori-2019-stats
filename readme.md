# bandori-2019-stats

## Overview

BanG Dream (also known as Bandori) is a multi-media franchise featuring an Android/iOS rhythm game, music from various bands, as well as anime and other media.

The general goal of this project is to use the results of the [4th Official /r/BanGDream Survey](https://www.reddit.com/r/BanGDream/comments/ej8ea3/4th_official_rbangdream_survey_results/) to learn about and visualize relationships between demographics, behaviour, and opinions in the BanG Dream fanbase. The project essentially exists as a collection of classes that help do this.

## Getting Started

It is highly recommended to check out the tutorial/quick-start (found [here](https://github.com/supreme-chocomint/bandori-2019-stats/blob/master/notebooks/tutorial.ipynb) as a Jupyter notebook, or [here](https://supreme-chocomint.github.io/bandori-2019-stats/) as a static website) to learn about the provided classes, what they do, how to use them, and their limitations.

If you'd rather just read code and inline documentation, start with `miner.py`, `snsplotters.py`, and `plotters.py`. Those are where the main classes are located.

## Example Output

See [here](https://github.com/supreme-chocomint/bandori-2019-stats/tree/master/output). Most example output is created using the ready-to-use methods, so can be easily replicated.
